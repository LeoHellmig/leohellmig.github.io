Beetle brawl is a student project developed by first year students at Breda University of Applied Sciences in 2023.

This Unreal Engine project served as my springboard into team oriented and product oriented development. During this project I explored what Unreal Engine had to offer. I learnt the ways of collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team by applying the SCRUM methodology and using Perforce as our source control solution. In this project I was mainly responsible for Levels, UI, Audio.
